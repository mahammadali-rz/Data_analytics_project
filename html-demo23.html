<h2>Data Analytics 2023 - Final Project 23</h2>
<h3> December 18 - 21, 2023</h3>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The data in the file  is about student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires</p>
<p>The general task of your project is to understand what impacts success in the two subjects <em>Mathematics</em> and <em>Portuguese</em>.</p>
<p>Task 1: Build a predictive model for the target variable <strong>G1.Math</strong> without using any of the other grade features.
Moreover, your model must contain the variables <strong>paid.Math, higher, absences.Port, paid.Port</strong> but not the variables <strong>Fedu, address, Mjob</strong>.</p>
<p>Task 2: Bin the target variable <strong>G1.Math</strong> into <strong>4</strong> categories in such a way that the resulting bins contain roughly equal number of cases. Use this newly created categorical variable as response for a classification model. Again do no tuse any other grade feature and build a model that contains the variables <strong>paid.Math, higher, absences.Port, paid.Port</strong> but not the variables <strong>Fedu, address, Mjob</strong>.</p>
<p>Here comes the explanation of the features included in the data set:</p>
